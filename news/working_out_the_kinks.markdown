I'm still trying to bend this theme that I like to my will making it fit this blog a little better. I'm also trying to gather together my notes on the way this world in my mind goes together. Once I've got a few more things worked out I should be ready to start writing a little more regularly.

*Update:* Well I haven't quite gotten the news section worked out the way I'd like but I've been looking at a lot of php code and wordpress documentation and I haven't found a way to make it work the way I want it too. As a result I've kind of given up on making only the posts in the news category from the last 30 days show up. If by any chance some one sees this and has an answer to that little dilemma I'd love to hear about it in the comments.
