Alycard's renders are typically of ugly, unoccupied inn rooms which suits my purposes well. Taverns of ill repute rarely notice if the person staying in the room is the same person who paid for the room. And if they do notice they know better than to ask questions or expect answers. As soon as I've gathered my wits I take stock of my surroundings. I'm slightly off the center of the room looking at the door which is approximately three steps in front of me, the bed is just wide enough for me to lay down next to myself and is a short step to my right. The bed itself looks to be a little moldy and moth eaten and it smells of old drunks. There is a rickety chair just within arms reach to my left pushed underneath a waist high shelf.

After taking stock of my surroundings I check my daggers and the rest of my gear. It's part habit and part paranoia. I've had a number of lessons on magic and wizards, I know how it works and I know it is bent only to the will of the one who manipulated it. I'm also relatively certain that Alycard's magical tool wouldn't be foolish enough to steal from someone like me, someone with my training but it takes only a moment to be certain. The first thing I check for is my prize, my favorite short blade kept in a hidden sheath under my shirt. I can feel it's weight shift as I look around but I give a quick touch just to be certain. It's a beautifully simple weapon with a well oiled slightly worn leather grip just below a mild crosspiece with thin spikes running up along a notched, scarred, razor sharp blade. As soon as I'm sure there's a blade there and that it's the right blade I make a cursory pass over my other weapons but none hold the importance to me of the first.

Once I'm satisfied I head towards the door and downstairs. It's late but I can hear the raucous in the common area from the room, I know I can still get plenty done this evening. As I walk out I'm rearranging my blades so I've only got one visible on my left hip. It doesn't take much, untuck a shirt, flip a sheath around, move a sheath up my forearm, pull my pant legs out over my boots. It's not the fashion so I'll be a little out of place, but not as much as if I had six blades visible. As I enter the common area I look around quickly for somewhere to sit. There's a lot of open chairs but no open tables so I take a seat on a bench near the middle of the room and try to get the barmaid's attention.

As I bark my order to the over what amounts to an indiscernible collection of conversations I take another look around the room focusing more closely on the condition of the patrons. I absorb details amorphously but use each to assemble the puzzle of this place, this assignment. Most interesting to me are the number of people carrying long blades and other weapons, the majority of them look uncomfortable with the weight of their armaments so they are almost certainly new to them. Of the twenty-three patrons twenty-two are carrying a visible weapon, fourteen of those are carrying weapons larger than daggers and of those a quarter of them look comfortable with steel strapped to their belts. Additionally I can tell by the way the barkeep's eyes that he's seen his share of blood and I can tell by the way he walks tenderly on his right leg some of it was his own. The important question remaining is whether the barkeep's blood was spilled in the personal war raging in the area or if it defending his livelihood here, both seem plausible but given his comfort with what looks like armed soldiers I'm guessing he was a soldier of some sort.

Now I'm thinking it to be likely the barkeep will prove a valuable source of information so I start watching more closely his interaction with the soldiers in his bar while nursing the drink I ordered. I don't hold my liquor as well as I should but it is important to always have my wits about me when on a job. Since information gathering is crucial to any assignment and taverns tend to be veritable fonts of information I've become a adept at hiding the portions of the drinks I purposefully waste.
