# A Call to Action by Chaos
------------------

As is customary my contact Alycard got in touch with me about a job needing attention. I was living in relative comfort after my last commission but there was a need welling up inside of me. I needed to do something, anything really I just wasn't involved and I wasn't feeling connected to what was going on around me so I decided to take the job without any real research.<!--more--> When I told Alycard immediately I accepted he seemed a little surprised (which for him probably meant he was absolutely shocked), after all he knew it was customary for me to do a little research and so he expected me to want at least a day to look into things.

As soon as I accepted I went to work preparing to travel, packing up my daggers, special treasures and rewards as well as my dark suit for night work. Once I had all the important things packed I went directly down and got myself in touch with Alycard's wizard to get my transport taken care of. I know the commission I pay for the quick transport is too much, but this job is a couple days ride away and I want to get into it and quickly.

I travel quietly through the town at night even with all my gear stashed on my body, I don't want to have to kill anyone just for seeing me and asking to many questions so I play it as carefully as possible. I make it to the wizard place without incident, but this guy's house always gives me the creeps. I've been around people with talent and empowered items for most of my life, but it still makes me nervous how casually this guy handles it all. I think it's because regardless of how well I know I hide what I'm thinking I can't help but think this wizard knows the exact thoughts passing through my head. Whether he knows what I plan or not he's all to willing when I offer the ruby for rapid transport across a fairly short distance. I provide the wizard with the rendering of the place Alycard gave me in order to ensure our safe travels, the way I understand these things the better the more accurate the image the wizard has to focus on the easier the trip.

As with the other couple of times I have used Alycard's wizard the journey is over in the blink of an eye and before I've gotten my legs under me and my wits about me the wizard is gone again; now it is time for the real work to begin.
